                Dear Mr Villani, <br>
                <br>
                You have made Digital such a fun class through the years. You have been an endless source of inspiration, encouragement, knowledge, humour, and plain old fun, and I have enjoyed and I appreciate everything you've given to us. I just hope that you've enjoyed it as much as we have :). <br>
                Villani army forever! <br>
                We'll miss you, <br>

                Hi Mr Villani :) <br>
                <br>
                Thank you for being such a super cool teacher! You are always so supportive of all of us and we really appreciate how much you care. Your enthusiasm makes every lesson super fun, and your humour and lightheartedness has been a real comfort for us during so many stressful periods this year. We have been so lucky to have had you as our teacher :D <br>
                Thank you again, and know that we will miss you next year! <br>

                Hey Mr Villani, thanks for being an awesome teacher over the years since I had you (I had you since years 8-12 except for year 9!! You've been my teacher for 4 years!! How awesome is that??) I won't ever forget your way of engaging us in lessons, and I thank you a lot for your help, ever since grade 8 with expert systems, the gaming project you forced us to make (and also extended the due date for me too), the Arduino stuff and so much more! Your classes have been memorable, and even though I've always been a slacker in your class, I promise that its one of the only classes in school that I always look forward to go to. Wish you the best sir!! Danke Schön and Auf Wiedersehen!! <br>

                I received the opportunity to learn from you for the past 5 years, in which I can certainly say that I have enjoyed myself through our technological discussions. While learning with you, I learnt life skills and understood the importance of time management through the weekly checkpoints for our folios. I would like to say that without you I would have found class more boring. I really appreciate what you have done for us throughout our time together, and I hope that we shall meet in the future. But until then, Villani Army forever✊! Thank you, Mr Villani, for being such a great teacher. Also, Macs > Windows, Apple > Android. <br>

                Hi Mr Villani <br>

                You were the one of the most comedic and casual teachers I've had the pleasure of learning from. One of the greatest things I've learnt from you is the sheer amount of critical thinking skills from doing so much logic and problem solving. Whilst the syllabus wasn't one of the more interesting components of Digital Solutions, your humour and engagement with different activities make this class so much more memorable and entertaining. <br>

                PS: TinyTown was the greatest peak in Digital Solutions content and truly one of the towns of all time. <br>

                Hi Mr Villaniiiiiii <br>
                I am going to be heartfelt so ENDURE THE CRINGE (because I have to as well). Firstly thank you so much for being such a good teacher for the past two years. I’ve very much enjoyed it and learnt heaps (So I can confirm you are in fact a good teacher :)). Genuinely thank you so much for the help and answering all my questions!!!!!!! Also thanks for being a cool teacher, you’re very funny even though you have made fun of me -.- (but it’s okay because I assume you followed in Mrs Holton’s footsteps). Anyways, this class has given me some of the best laughs, so thank you for that. Also sorry for going on my phone and being late because of a r t :D woopsies. <br>
                Anywayssss I will miss our digital solutions class!! ): <br>
                - All the best, Sama :) :) :) <br>
